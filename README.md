# ARP-PCB-Mill

Description:
This is a mini pcb mill thats portable and able to continuously mill 60mmx60mm copper clad. This mill can also be used for other light materials like aluminum or plastic but its primarily for making pcbs. Its made of aluminum extrusions for rigidity and uses lead screws to ensure it can cut fast without skipping steps. I tried to make this poject as a grind project for the pcb mill challenge.

Why:
Well its for the PCB mill challenge for open sauce and I love cnc machining and pcbs so having a pcb mill would be really nice. And its cool knowing how fast I made this.
