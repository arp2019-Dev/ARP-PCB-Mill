# June 16th: Working on the Main structure

Worked on the main structure, which is a simple 3-axis router-style CNC. 
Using a small 775 DC motor spindle with ER11 collets. And Nema17 Motors with 8mm leadscrews due to cutting forces. 
The structure is a 2040 aluminum extrusion for its cost, simplicity, and rigidity. For rails, I'm using MGN12H for 
x and Y, and then MGN9H for z. I will now work on the motor mounts and add all the connecting plates, as well as a small clamp for the copper clad.

# June 16th: Working on the motor mounts and BOM
LMAO it's done, did this for the PCB mill challenge and just locked in for 5 hours and designed it. I added all the brackets and motor mounts. Mostly 3D printed. The copper clad will be held down using double sided tape.
